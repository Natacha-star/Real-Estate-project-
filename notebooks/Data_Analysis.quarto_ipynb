        "* **Mode (Most Frequent Range)**:\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Density Curve (KDE)**:\n",
        "  The smooth blue curve overlays the bars and visually reinforces the distribution shape. The sharp rise and gradual taper highlight the **concentration of mid-priced properties**, followed by a **long tail** extending toward higher prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Spread**:\n",
        "  Sale amounts range broadly from near **\\$0 up to around \\$700,000**, with fewer properties selling at the extremes. The lower end includes possible undervalued or distressed sales, while the upper end includes premium properties.\n",

        "* **Implications**:\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Peak & Central Tendency**:\n",
        "  The distribution peaks around a **Sales Ratio of \\~0.65**, indicating that most properties were sold for about **65% of their assessed value**. This suggests a tendency toward undervaluation or conservative government assessments.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Distribution Shape**:\n",
        "  The plot is **slightly right-skewed**, but generally resembles a **bell-shaped (normal-like) curve**. The bulk of the properties lie between **0.5 and 0.8**, forming a concentrated central cluster.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Lower and Upper Bounds**:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Minimum** visible in this plot: around **0.3**\n",
        "  * **Maximum** visible: just above **1.0**, with very few properties exceeding the assessed value\n",
        "  * A **Sales Ratio of 1.0** represents a perfect match between market sale and assessed value. Only a **small tail** of properties is observed beyond that point.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Market Insight**:\n",
        "  The fact that the vast majority of Sales Ratios are **below 1.0** implies that properties in this dataset typically sold for **less than their assessed value**, which could reflect:\n",
        "\n",

        "  \n",
        "\n",
        " - A Sales Ratio below 1.0 (which is the majority) suggests that most properties were sold for less than their assessed value, potentially indicating that assessments are overestimated.\n",
        "\n",
        " - A Sales Ratio close to or above 1.0 suggests properties that sold at or above their assessed valuesâ€”this may indicate strong demand or accurate valuation.\n",
