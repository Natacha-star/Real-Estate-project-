# Real Estate Sales Analysis (2016-2019)
This project explores property sales data from 2016 to 2019, focusing on residential transactions across multiple towns. The analysis covers price trends, valuation accuracy, and property categories.

- **Assessed Value**: Government-estimated property value
- **Sales Ratio**: Sale Amount / Assessed Value
- **Residential Type**: Property structure (e.g., Condo, Single Family)
- **Town** and **List Year**


## Data Cleaning
